# post_it_replacer

The project tasks are focused on developing graphical user interfaces (GUI) for replacing the post-
it note area in image, video and live stream with loaded image using OpenCV-Python library.

GUI is a form of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graph-
ical icons, instead of text-based user interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation.

OpenCV-Python is a library of Python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems. As
an interdisciplinary scientific field, computer vision deals with how computers can gain high-level
understanding from digital images or videos.
